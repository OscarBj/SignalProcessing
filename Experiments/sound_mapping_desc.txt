- reference signal
- combine with measured signal
- component analysis for separation
- noise reduction, common noisy frequencies

% example 1%
every value in each sensor is matched to a profile.
matrix contains therefore profiles that it is matched to at this moment
for example 1 = tap is running, 2 = 

% example 2%
matrix contains raw & profiled values
sound data is profiled, humidity etc is raw values
matrix needs to be further processed and mapped to profile
-> column 1 = sound profile, column 2 = humidity, column 3 = temperature
conclusion: all measurements with high sample rate is profiled before
inserted in matrix, other samples come as raw values

if we send data (matrix) to server 1 times per second, high sample rate measurements gets profiled using a 1s sliding window
other measurements comes raw

1) match frequency and 2) consistency of the frequency in the signal

1) signal contains this frequency, and has an amplitude according tothreshold
2) if 1) is fulfilled, we verify that the frequency does appear in certain pattern

Use spectral coherence for retrieving similarity in freq and amp

Use cross spectral power density to get ratio between db/Hz and Hz (each frequency has a db/Hz value wich corresponds to the combined power)
